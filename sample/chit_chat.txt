D                         Bm
Hey there drama, are you into karma?
 F#m                             A
Cause I'm dying to believe you're next
           D
Oh is your mind erasing?
              Bm
Well then you better chase it
          F#m                       A
Cause the thought it scaring me to death
        D
Can you feel it?
        Bm

        F#m
Are you shaking?

       A                         D
Do you know that it's never ever gonna be the way you want it?
Bm                      F#m
So come on get your fix now, now, now
A
You drive me crazy with that

Chit chat, do you want that or wanna take me home tonight? All this chit chat is holding me back.
F#m                            A      D                      Bm
I'm breaking just to bend your light. I thought I told you I really need your sugar
F#m               A
A roller coaster, I'm going supernova
D                 Bm                   F#m  A

D                     Bm
Hello reason, are you into treason?
       F#m                  A
Do you mind if I steal your heart?
D
Is it something sacred?
              Bm                       F#m               A
More than you tried to make it and you slowly let it rip apart
 
[Pre-Chorus]
D
It's never gonna be the way you want it
Bm                      F#m
