## Sprints

Part 1:

* Will be able to successfully send a query to the API
* Will be able to successfully receive data from the API
* Will output the return data in chords and lyrics format (with hard-coded query)

Part 2:

* Create a Discord bot that can produce output
* The bot can receive input and produce output
* The bot can display chord/lyric format
* The bot can successfully apply Part 1


Part 3:

* Make a web scraper for the search results on ultimate guitar that only returns chord type results
* Inputting an artist and song will return the first 5 (at most) chord results
* The Discord bot will be able to receive artist - song input and return a list of the results
* When the user chooses one of those results, the bot will correctly display the chord/lyric format for that specific chord tab
